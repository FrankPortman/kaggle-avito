### Quote

- One interesting thing I discovered was that setting -b to the maximum (29 on my computer) was not optimal. Because there were so many categorical values, many of which were just adding noise, having a lower b value produced more collisions, which actually helped generalise the model. Langford mentions this as a possibility in one of his slides.
